## Hello there 👋

{% assign currentYear = "Now" | date: "%Y" %}
{% assign startedWorkingYear = "April 2019" | date: "%Y" %}


![my face](/assets/face.jpeg){: width="200px" class="avatar" }  My name is Josef Reichelt and I like to code things.  

I'm a web frontend developer with {{ currentYear | minus:  startedWorkingYear  }} years of working experience in **React** but my passion and focus is game development.  

Currently I enjoy exploring making games from scratch as much as possible with **C++**.  

What I love the most:

- My son 👦
- My wife 👱‍♀️
- Games 🕹
- Listening to movie and game OST 🎧
- Game development 💾
